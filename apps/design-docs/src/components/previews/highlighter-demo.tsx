                    Sometimes you need to draw attention to <Highlighter action="highlight" color="#fef08a" animationDuration={800} triggerOnView>specific words</Highlighter> in a paragraph to make sure the user reads them.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Or you might want to show that something is <Highlighter action="strike-through" color="#f87171" strokeWidth={2} triggerOnView>no longer applicable</Highlighter> without actually removing the text.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    You can also <Highlighter action="underline" color="#60a5fa" strokeWidth={3} iterations={3} triggerOnView>underline key concepts</Highlighter> to give them emphasis, similar to what you would do with a pen in a book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For really important metrics, maybe you want to <Highlighter action="circle" color="#34d399" strokeWidth={2} padding={5} triggerOnView>circle</Highlighter> them.
                </p>
