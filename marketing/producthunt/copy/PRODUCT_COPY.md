## Maker's First Comment

**This is crucial - it sets the tone for the entire launch.**

### Version A (Story-Driven)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Tseka, founder of Nebutra Intelligence. For years, I watched talented developers build amazing AI demos... that never became real products.

The gap wasn't coding ability. It was everything else: multi-tenant architecture, billing, compliance, security, observability. The "boring" 10% that takes 90% of the time.

So I built Nebutra Sailor — an open-source SaaS platform that handles all that enterprise complexity, while staying AI-native and developer-friendly.

**What makes it different:**

🏢 **Multi-tenant from day 1** — RLS, org isolation, tenant-scoped everything
🤖 **AI-native** — LLMs, embeddings, MCP agents, RAG patterns built-in
💳 **Monetization-ready** — Stripe billing, usage metering, feature gates
🔒 **Enterprise security** — WAF, GDPR/CCPA, audit logs, Turnstile
🎨 **White-label** — Fork it, brand it, ship it

**Tech stack:**
Next.js 17 · React 19 · TypeScript · Prisma 7 · Supabase · Vercel AI SDK

We're fully open source (MIT + Commons Clause), so you can inspect every line of code.

I'd love to hear:
- What features would make this more useful for your next project?
- What's the hardest part of shipping SaaS for you?

Happy to answer any questions! 🚀
```

### Version B (Concise)

```
Hey PH! 👋

I'm Tseka. After seeing too many great AI demos fail to become products, I built what I wished existed: an enterprise SaaS foundation that's actually open source.

**Nebutra Sailor gives you:**
• Multi-tenant architecture with RLS
• AI-native patterns (LLMs, embeddings, MCP)
• Billing & monetization (Stripe)
• Security & compliance (GDPR, WAF)
• White-label ready

Built with Next.js 17, React 19, Prisma 7, and Supabase.

The code is open source — inspect every line, fork for your project, ship your SaaS.

Questions? Let me know! 🚀

The problem: AI makes building demos easy.

But shipping a REAL SaaS product? That's still hard.

Multi-tenant auth, billing, compliance, security, observability...

The "boring" 10% that takes 90% of the time.

```
🚀 Excited to announce: We just launched Nebutra Sailor on Product Hunt!

After months of work, we're sharing our open-source enterprise SaaS platform with the world.

**The problem we're solving:**
AI has made building demos incredibly fast. But shipping a real, profitable SaaS product? That's still painfully slow.

**What Nebutra Sailor provides:**
→ Multi-tenant architecture from day 1
→ AI/LLM integration built-in
→ Billing and monetization (Stripe)
→ Enterprise security and compliance
→ Production-ready, white-label capable

Built for solo founders and small teams who want enterprise-grade infrastructure without enterprise-grade complexity.

If you're building a SaaS in 2024/2025, I'd love your feedback.

## FAQ Responses

**Q: Is this really free?**

```
Yes! MIT + Commons Clause license. Free for personal projects, learning, and internal tools. Commercial use requires keeping it open source. Enterprise licensing available for closed-source commercial use.
```

**Q: How is this different from [Next.js SaaS Starter / Shipfast / etc]?**

```
Most starters give you auth + billing basics. Nebutra is a complete enterprise architecture: multi-tenant RLS, AI-native patterns, rate limiting, caching strategies, observability, compliance features. It's more like a platform than a starter.
```

**Q: Can I use this for my startup?**

```
Absolutely! That's exactly what it's built for. Fork it, customize it, and ship. If you want to keep your code proprietary, we offer enterprise licensing.
```

**Q: What's the learning curve?**

```
If you know Next.js and TypeScript, you'll feel at home. We have extensive documentation and each package has its own README. Most developers are productive within a day.
