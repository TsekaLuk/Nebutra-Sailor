## Questions

### General Technical Question

```
Great question! [Answer the question].

We have more details in our docs: docs.nebutra.com/[topic]

Happy to dive deeper if you have follow-up questions!
```

### "How is this different from X?"

```
Good question! The main differences are:

1. [Key differentiator 1]
2. [Key differentiator 2]
3. [Key differentiator 3]

That said, [competitor] is great for [their use case]. We're focused on [our niche].

Happy to help you evaluate which fits your needs!
```

### Pricing / Licensing

```
We're MIT + Commons Clause license:
- ✅ Free for personal projects and learning
- ✅ Free for internal tools
- ✅ Free if you keep it open source
- 💼 Enterprise licensing for closed-source commercial use

What's your use case? Happy to clarify!
```

### "Is it production-ready?"

```
Yes! We've been running parts of this in production for [X months].

The architecture patterns are battle-tested: multi-tenant RLS, rate limiting, circuit breakers, etc.

That said, like any framework, you'll want to adapt it to your specific needs. Happy to discuss any concerns!
```

### "What's the learning curve?"

```
If you know Next.js and TypeScript, you'll feel at home quickly.

Most developers are productive within a day. Each package has its own README, and we have detailed docs at docs.nebutra.com.

What's your current stack? I can point you to the right starting point!
