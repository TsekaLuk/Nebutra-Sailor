# Product Hunt Launch Plan

## Executive Summary

**Product:** Nebutra Sailor - The Open-Source Enterprise SaaS Platform  
**Launch Type:** Scheduled Launch (Tuesday-Thursday recommended)  
**Duration:** 24-hour voting window (12:01 AM PT)

## Strategic Positioning

### Why Now?

1. **Vibe Coding Trend** - AI-assisted coding is mainstream, but shipping profitable products remains hard
2. **Solopreneur Movement** - More one-person companies need enterprise-grade tools
3. **Open Source Momentum** - Developers prefer self-hostable, transparent solutions
4. **AI-Native Demand** - Every new SaaS needs LLM integration from day 1

### Unique Angle

> "From Vibe Coding to Vibe Business" — The missing link between AI-generated demos and revenue-generating products.
